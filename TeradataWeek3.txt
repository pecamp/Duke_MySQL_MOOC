# Exercise 1: (a) Use COUNT and DISTINCT to determine how many distinct skus there are in pairs of the
skuinfo, skstinfo, and trnsact tables. Which skus are common to pairs of tables, or unique to specific
tables?

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT a.sku)
FROM skuinfo a JOIN skstinfo b

# 714499

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT b.sku)
FROM skstinfo b JOIN trnsact c

#542513

# (b) Use COUNT to determine how many instances there are of each sku associated with each store in the
skstinfo table and the trnsact table? 

SELECT sku, store, COUNT(sku) AS NumSKUs
FROM skstinfo 
GROUP BY sku, store
ORDER BY NumSKUs DESC;

# Max 1 NumSKUs - unique combination of SKU and store

SELECT sku, store, COUNT(sku) AS NumSKUs
FROM trnsact 
GROUP BY sku, store
ORDER BY NumSKUs DESC;

# Max 7933 NumSKUs at SKU 4628597504 STORE 504

# Exercise 2: (a) Use COUNT and DISTINCT to determine how many distinct stores there are in the
strinfo, store_msa, skstinfo, and trnsact tables. 

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT store)
FROM strinfo;

#453

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT store)
FROM store_msa;

#333

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT store)
FROM skstinfo;

#357

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT store)
FROM trnsact;

# (b) Which stores are common to all four tables, or unique to specific tables? 

# Since skstinfo has the most unique stores, we join skstinfo first.

SELECT a.store
FROM strinfo a 
  LEFT JOIN skstinfo b 
    ON a.store = b.store
  LEFT JOIN trnsact c 
    ON a.store = c.store
  LEFT JOIN store_msa d

# Examine some of the rows in the trnsact table that are not in the skstinfo table;
can you find any common features that could explain why the cost information is missing? 

SELECT *

  LEFT JOIN skstinfo s
    ON t.sku=s.sku AND t.store = s.store
WHERE s.sku IS NULL 

# Exercise 4: Although we can’t complete all the analyses we’d like to on Dillard’s profit, we can look at
general trends. What is Dillard’s average profit per day? 

SELECT SUM(t.amt-s.cost)/COUNT(DISTINCT t.saledate) AS AvgProfit
FROM trnsact t LEFT JOIN skstinfo s
ON t.sku = s.sku AND t.store = s.store
WHERE t.stype = 'P';

# 1527903.46

# If you are calculating the average profit per day correctly, you will find that the average profit per day from
register 640 is $10,779.20.

SELECT SUM(t.amt-s.cost)/COUNT(DISTINCT t.saledate) AS AvgProfit
FROM trnsact t LEFT JOIN skstinfo s
ON t.sku = s.sku AND t.store = s.store

# Correct: 10779.20

# Exercise 5: On what day was the total value (in $) of returned goods the greatest? On what day was the
total number of individual returned items the greatest? 

SELECT saledate, SUM(amt) AS TotalSum
FROM trnsact
WHERE stype = 'R'
GROUP BY saledate
ORDER BY TotalSum DESC;

# 04/12/27 - $3030259.76

SELECT saledate, SUM(quantity) AS TotalQuantity

# 04/12/27 - 82512

# A few days after Christmas

# Exercise 6: What is the maximum price paid for an item in our database? What is the minimum price
paid for an item in our database? 

SELECT max(amt)
FROM trnsact
WHERE stype = 'P';

SELECT min(amt)
FROM trnsact
WHERE stype = 'P';

# Max: $6017.00 - Min: $0.00

# Exercise 7: How many departments have more than 100 brands associated with them, and what are their
descriptions? 

SELECT s.dept, d.deptdesc, COUNT(brand) AS NumBrands
FROM skuinfo s LEFT JOIN deptinfo d
ON s.dept = d.dept
GROUP BY s.dept, d.deptdesc
HAVING NumBrands > 100
ORDER BY NumBrands DESC;

# 60 rows to this table

Exercise 8: Write a query that retrieves the department descriptions of each of the skus in the skstinfo
table. 

SELECT a.sku, b.dept, c.deptdesc
FROM skstinfo a LEFT JOIN skuinfo b
ON a.sku = b.sku
LEFT JOIN deptinfo c
ON b.dept = c.dept;

# If you have written your query correctly, you will find that the department description for sku #5020024 is
“LESLIE”

SELECT TOP 1 a.sku, b.dept, c.deptdesc
FROM skstinfo a LEFT JOIN skuinfo b
ON a.sku = b.sku
LEFT JOIN deptinfo c
ON b.dept = c.dept
WHERE a.sku = 5020024;

# The answer is "LESLIE"

# Exercise 9: What department (with department description), brand, style, and color had the greatest total
value of returned items? 

SELECT TOP 1 s.dept, d.deptdesc, s.brand, s.style, s.color, SUM(t.amt) as SumAmt
FROM trnsact t LEFT JOIN skuinfo s
ON t.sku = s.sku
LEFT JOIN deptinfo d
ON s.dept = d.dept
WHERE t.stype = 'R'
GROUP BY s.dept, d.deptdesc, s.brand, s.style, s.color
ORDER BY SumAmt DESC;

# Output: 4505 POLOMEN POLO FAS 4GZ 782633 U KHAKI 216633.59

# If you have written your query correctly, you will find that the department with the 5th highest total value of
returned items is #2200 with a department description of “CELEBRT”, a brand of “LANCOME”, a style of
“1042”, a color of “00-NONE”, and a total value of returned items of $177,142.50.

# 2200 CELEBRT LANCOME 1042 00-NONE 177142.50

# Exercise 10: In what state and zip code is the store that had the greatest total revenue during the time
period monitored in our dataset? 

SELECT TOP 10 s.state, s.city, s.zip, SUM(t.amt) as SumAmt
FROM trnsact t LEFT JOIN strinfo s
ON t.store = s.store
WHERE t.stype = 'P'
GROUP BY s.state, s.city, s.zip
ORDER BY SumAmt DESC;

# Output: LA 70002 24171426.58

# If you have written your query correctly, you will find that the department with the 10th highest total revenue is
in Hurst, TX. 	

# Output 10th row: TX HURST 76053 17740181.20
